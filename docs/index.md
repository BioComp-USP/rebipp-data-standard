# Plant-Pollinator Data Standard

<p class="lead">This is a standard maintained by Brazilian Network on Plant-Pollinator Interactions (REBIPP). It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to <strong>facilitate the sharing of information about plant-pollinator interactions</strong> by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions. Plant-Pollinator Interactions (PPI) data standard is designed as a extension of Darwin Core standard and, so, it is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, samples, and related information.</p>
